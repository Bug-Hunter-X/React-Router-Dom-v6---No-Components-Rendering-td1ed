# React Router Dom v6 - No Components Rendering

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router Dom v6: components failing to render despite correctly defined routes.  The provided solution illustrates how to effectively resolve this problem.

## Problem

In the original `App.js`, React Router v6 is set up, but none of the route components render. The browser URL updates correctly, showing the navigation working, however the content area stays blank. This is a frequent issue caused by minor oversights in the component structure or the routing configuration.

## Solution

The `AppSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that addresses the rendering issue. The solution is typically related to missing or incorrect elements within the component structure and ensuring the proper nesting of route elements.  Refer to the corrected code for the specific fix implemented in this scenario.
